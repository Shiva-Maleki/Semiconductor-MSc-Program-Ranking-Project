# 🎓 Semiconductor MSc Program Ranking Project

This project ranks **Master’s programs in Semiconductors** based on key evaluation criteria such as **Reputation, Faculty Quality, Industry Connections, Tuition Fees, and Job Placement.** It provides **data-driven rankings and visualizations** to help prospective students make informed decisions.

## 📌 Features
- ✅ Uses **weighted ranking metrics** for accurate evaluation.
- ✅ **Heatmap visualization** for clear program comparison.
- ✅ Saves a **CSV file** with ranked results.
- ✅ Analyzes **tuition fees, reputation, and job placement.**

## 📂 Dataset
The ranking is based on:
- **University Reputation**
- **Faculty Expertise**
- **Industry Collaborations**
- **Student Reviews & Job Placement Rates**
- **Tuition Fees & Program Flexibility**

## 📊 Visualizations
The program generates **a heatmap to compare key metrics across universities.**
